# Genshin Impact "Patches since last run for limited 5-star character" Infographics website
This website was made by me in order to facilitate creation of and storing of infographics which I make for hoyolab.

I previously made these using PowerPoint and it was slow, arduous, and prone to
formatting errors and inconsistencies.

**Currently, the site is not up and running as I will rewrite the entire thing to work off Jekyll.**
Since this a server-side app built on Node.js, I have to turn this into static html to publish on pages.

## How to run this server app on your local machine:
If you're interested in seeing this website in action then:
1. Clone this repository or download the entire code on to your machine.
2. Run the `run.bat` file located in the root directory of this repo.
3. The program should run and be accessible by going to your browser of choice and going to `localhost:5000`.

Coming soon:tm:
